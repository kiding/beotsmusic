> __BeotsMusic__ has been discontinued as _[Beats Music](http://beatsmusic.com)_ is now _[Apple Music](http://www.apple.com/music)_.

## What's BeotsMusic?

BeotsMusic is a Mac OS X application which brings __[Beats Music](http://beatsmusic.com)__ to the desktop without using a browser.

### Why is that good?

- No more 'trying to find in which tab is __Beats Music__ running'..
- Media keys support! (Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)
- Headphones remote (Apple Mikey) support!
- ~~No Flash plugin required.~~ __Currently broken.__
- AppleScript support.
- Stops on suspend.

### BeotsMusic is a weird name. How to pronounce it?

I don't know, but you can get a clue from [SoundCleod](https://soundcloud.com/senart/soundcleod).

## How to get it?

- [Download the latest from here.](https://github.com/kiding/beotsmusic/releases)
- Double click the file.
- Drag BeotsMusic into your Applications folder.
- Go to Applications, double click BeotsMusic.
- Optionally drag BeotsMusic from Applications into the Dock.

**Important!** Minimum required OSX version is 10.7 (Lion).

## Screenshots? Yeah!

## Alternatives
- Any modern web browser
- [BeardedSpice](http://beardedspice.com/) (Mac)

## Disclaimer

__Beats Music__ the service itself doesn't support keyboard shortcuts unlike __SoundCloud__. That means, the method being used here is a bit more hackery than the predecessor, [SoundCleod](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod).

Use at your own _higher_ risk. It might destroy the Earth. Or better don't use it.
